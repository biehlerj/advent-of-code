# Advent of Code

This repository contains my work done for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). It is separated by year and each
year uses a different programming language as my goal is to use the challenge to learn new languages.

## Years

- [2021](./2021/README.md): For the first year I participate in Advent of Code I have chosen to use Java as it is a language I am unfamiliar with,
but need to use for work.
